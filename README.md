# Atom Auto Resize

Keep Atom window minimal by resizing it automatically when panes/docks are
opened or closed. This is convenient in case you place Atom and some other
application side-by-side (e.g. a browser), and you only occasionally need to
open some of the Atom docks or another text editor pane. The plugin does
nothing if Atom window is in fullscreen or maximized state.

Tips:

* Configure your preferred text editor pane width in package settings.
* Use this package in conjunction with the
[Atom Auto Docks](https://atom.io/packages/atom-auto-docks) package.
* Avoid keeping [Tree View](https://atom.io/packages/tree-view) open all the
time by opening files using the
[Fuzzy Finder](https://atom.io/packages/fuzzy-finder), or by using extra
packages like the [Advanced Open File](https://atom.io/packages/advanced-open-file).
* If you are working on a laptop, you might want to adjust your font size
and remove all unnecessary empty space from the sides of your text editor pane
by modifying your stylesheet.
