# atom-auto-resize

Keep Atom window minimal by resizing it automatically when panes/docks are
opened or closed. This is convenient when you place Atom and some other
application side-by-side (e.g. a browser), and you only occasionally need to
open split view or some of the Atom docks.

The plugin does nothing when Atom window is in fullscreen or maximized state.

Configure your preferred text editor width in package settings. If you are
working with a laptop, you might also want to remove all extra space from the
sides of you text editor by modifying your stylesheet.

TODOs:
* Keybinging for closing all additional docks and panes
* Screenshot
* Specs
