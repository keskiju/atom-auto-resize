# atom-auto-resize

Keep Atom window at a minimal size by resizing window automatically when
panes/docks are opened or closed. This is convenient when you place Atom
and some other application side-by-side (e.g. a browser), and you only
occasionally need to open split view or some of the Atom docks.

The plugin does nothing when Atom window is in fullscreen or maximized state.
