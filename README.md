# Atom Auto Resize

Keep Atom window minimal by resizing it automatically when panes/docks are
opened or closed. This is convenient when you place Atom and some other
application side-by-side (e.g. a browser), and you only occasionally need to
open some of the Atom docks or another text editor pane.

The plugin does nothing when Atom window is in fullscreen or maximized state.

Tips:

* Configure your preferred text editor pane width in package settings.
* Avoid keeping [Tree View](https://atom.io/packages/tree-view) open all the
time by opening files using
[Fuzzy Finder](https://atom.io/packages/fuzzy-finder), or by using extra
packages like [Advanced Open File](https://atom.io/packages/advanced-open-file).
* If you are working on a laptop, you might want to adjust your font size
and remove all unnecessary space from the sides of your text editor pane by
modifying your stylesheet.

* Keybinding for closing all additional docks and panes
